<h1 align="center">Fritz Recognizer - Images</h1>

## :star: Motivation

This work was done in 2020, during the quarantine (Covid-19). In this scenario, the CBR (Brazilian Robotics Competition) took place in a virtual environment in November 2020. 

One of the tasks to be developed by the teams was the identification of People in an image, drawn at each round and each team. 

The objective was to identify if the people in the image were wearing a mask or not. If they were without a mask, to extract the gender and age of each one.

Representing the RoboFEI@HOME team, I used the works referenced in the file "link.txt" and combined them to achieve the objective.

Our results can be seen in the video time:

- 47:00
- 1:22:50
- 2:01:25

## :bulb: Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in an image type the following command: 
```
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
